Project 1: Matching [ ], ( ) and { } (DASALGO)

to compile
javac -g Main.java
java Main

The left side is for inputting the code. The right side is where the output of the code will be.
If the UI is broken the command line is there and the output can be seen there.

The code was implemented using stakcs (self made functions). The idea is when the program sees an open ( { or [ it pushes it to the stack 
when the program then detects a } ) or ] the porgram pops the stack and compares if ( { or [ matches the right ) } ] if it does then the code is correct
if not then an error is occoured.
